	      <h2>About this Site</h2>
          <p class="stuffPara">Hello, and thanks for dropping in. You have reached the companion web site to the YouTube channel, <a class="extLink" href=""><strong>-1/12 bean.</strong></a> The channel and this site are about (among other things) this (in)famous equation:-</p>
		  <h2 style="padding-left: 2.5em; color: black; font-size: 18pt;">1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... = -1/12</h2>
          <p class="stuffPara">We will be making sense of this notorious equation by playing with some simulated <strong>thought experiments</strong> involving <strong>coffee beans </strong><img src="bean.png" style="width: 45px; vertical-align: bottom;"> and <strong>coffee powder. <img src="justHeap.png" style="width: 72px; vertical-align: bottom; "></strong></p>
          <p class="stuffPara">You'll probably get the most out of this site if you start with the <a ><button class="lilButton" >first video</button></a> in the series, then come back here. <br><span style="color: #ca3c28;">==== [N.B. video not yet uploaded] ====</span>
          </p>
		  <p class="stuffPara">The video complements these pages, giving you an overview and a guided tour, and highlighting the concepts that you take away from each experiment. Think of this site as a <strong>virtual lab</strong> where you can do interactive experiments, following along with the video and developing your <strong>intuition</strong> by actually <strong>doing stuff</strong>. Stuff that involves things like coffee beans, coffee powder... and <strong>toothpicks</strong>.

	      <h2>About the equation 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + .... = -1/12</h2>
          <p class="stuffPara">Since about 2014 that equation has gained a lot of attention from the general public, mainly because of a YouTube <a class="extLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww&t=8s">video</a> that went viral ( > 7 million views since then). That was followed by many reactions and follow-up videos, and the equation has since been discussed in mainstream magazine articles and in blogs by famously brilliant mathematicians. </p>

          <p class="stuffPara">This topic is interesting for several reasons. For one thing, it's obviously counter-intuitive. (If you add up bigger and bigger <strong>positive</strong> numbers all the way to infinity, the result can't be a <strong>small, negative</strong> number, right?)
		  </p>
		  <p class="stuffPara">Yet, in some way, it makes sense in certain branches of higher mathematics and physics. The equation has a huge celebrity quotient. It is linked with the contributions of great minds from <a class="extLink" href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/who-was-ramanujan/" target="_blank">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a> to  <strong>Bernhard Riemann</strong> to <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong>. Brilliant modern mathematicians like <strong>Terence Tao</strong> have discussed it in their <a class="extLink" href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/the-euler-maclaurin-formula-bernoulli-numbers-the-zeta-function-and-real-variable-analytic-continuation/"  target="_blank">blogs</a>. The <strong>New York Times</strong> ran an <a class="extLink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/science/in-the-end-it-all-adds-up-to.html" target="_blank">article</a> on it.</p>

	      <h2>Infinity in the Physical World</h2>
          <p class="stuffPara">One real-world killer app that's powered by this equation is a phenomenon in <strong>quantum physics</strong> called the <strong>Casimir Effect.</strong> This effect predicts that when we hold two gold plates parallel to each other less than a millionth of a meter apart, a small <strong>force</strong> is created that tries to move the plates closer together. In practical terms, the Casimir Force is a thing that designers of <strong>nano-scale mechanisms</strong> have to deal with, because it can actually interfere with the device's operation.</p>
		  
		  <p class="stuffPara">When you try to calculate the Casimir force between two parallel plates, you get an equation that tells you that the force depends on a certain amount of energy, which in turn is made up of an infinite number of tiny "lumps" or <strong>quanta</strong> of energy (more later). </p>
		  
		  <p class="stuffPara">That <strong>total</strong> energy is proportional to <strong>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + .... </strong>, adding up all the <strong>integers</strong> to infinity. This suggests that the force must be <strong>infinitely strong</strong>, which of course it <strong>isn't,</strong> not really. But it does turn out that you can get the correct answer if you just <strong>pretend</strong> that 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... is <strong>equal</strong> to <strong>-1/12.</strong></p>

           <p class="stuffPara">To many people, the fact that you can predict a physical effect using this strange equation is what makes it an irresistible challenge to understand. Certainly, that's how I felt when I watched those videos and began trying to make sense of all the material that's online.</p>

           <h2>Towards Infinity...</h2>
           <p class="stuffPara">To start with, we will explore some key concepts around the 1 + 2 + 3 + ... equation in a physically intuitive way. We will then connect those concepts to the Casimir Force. Subsequent videos will explore other related topics, and we will be adding more experiments to the virtual lab as well.</p>
		   
		   <p class="stuffPara">As a rough road map, there are actually three overlapping but distinct ideas to navigate. Our first couple of videos will address the first two points below:
		        <ul style="font-size: 14.5pt; color: #353d92">
				    <li>The number -1/12 has a special connection with the infinite series of integers, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ...</li>
					<li>There are certain physics problems that you can solve successfully if you just <strong style="color: #394095;">pretend</strong> that:<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ....  is <strong style="color: #394095;">equal</strong> to - 1 / 12.</li>
					<li>In some specific contexts in higher mathematics, it makes sense to <strong>define</strong> the sum of an infinite series like this one in a certain special way. Once we adopt that definition, the result -1/12 will pop out of the maths.</li>
			    </ul>
		    		
		   </p>
		   <p class="stuffPara">We will explore that last point in a future video (with experiments that we will add as well).</p>
		   <p class="stuffPara">If you have done a course in basic calculus, that will be a bit helpful... but if you haven't, you'll still be good. You will actually pick up some intuitive calculus as you go along, or at least the concepts that will help you to, um, <a class="extLink" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Knew_Infinity_(film)">"know infinity."</a><p/>
